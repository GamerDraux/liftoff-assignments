## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Runshare is an excercise tracking app that will allow
 users to create a listing of their running sessions
 , track times, and list the trails they have run, as
  well as share that information with others, allowing
   them to find new trails and share activities
   .  Personal information about age, activity level, and
    general location can either be shared, or hidden
    , depending on the user choices.  With multiple
     runners sharing their achievements and favorite
      trails, it will allow them to discover new trails
       in their area, and plan runs on new trails.  There
        will be a message board associated with each
         trail for comments, as well as a general board
          allowing them to discuss topics of interest
          , stories, and successes.  It will also allow
           runners to access current weather on a
            detailed trail, to see if it is a good day to
             run!
